# xray

**xray** is a developer-focused platform that brings together AI-powered chat, server-side tool/function execution, and live code/scraper testing into a single, modern web interface.

---

## Purpose

xray is designed to:

* Let you **chat with LLM-based assistants** and get instant responses,
* **Run and test server-side tools/functions directly from the UI**, using innovative features where the LLM itself can call and orchestrate backend tools,
* **Rapidly generate and test scrapers or automation scripts** in a sandboxed, interactive environment—cutting down the time between idea, implementation, and validation,
* Provide full transparency: see all tool calls, code outputs, and logs as you build and experiment.

xray **speeds up the process of developing, debugging, and iterating on automation workflows and data extraction tasks**.

## Who is xray for?

* Backend/frontend developers
* AI/ML and prompt engineers
* Teams building and testing APIs, tools, or scrapers
* Anyone needing a fast, UI-driven playground for technical prototyping

## Key Features

* Modern multi-model chat interface
* **Innovative function/tool execution from UI—LLMs can invoke tools automatically**
* Script panel for **live code and scraper testing**
* Output and log panels with full history
* Customizable, developer-friendly design
